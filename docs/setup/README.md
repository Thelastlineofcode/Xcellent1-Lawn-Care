# Setup Documentation (truncated)

The detailed setup files for agent development, BMAD integration, and environment configuration have been archived to `docs/archive/setup_full/` to reduce top-level documentation noise.

If you need the full step-by-step instructions, open the corresponding archived file, for example:

- `docs/archive/setup_full/START-HERE.full.md`
- `docs/archive/setup_full/BUILD-PLAN.full.md`
- `docs/archive/setup_full/SUPABASE_FLY_DATABASE_SETUP.full.md`

This folder now contains a short pointer and a readable summary in most files; use the archive to access the full content.
