notes: |
  - This sprint seeds core work to enable owner onboarding and basic crew mobile flows.
  - Update story `status` fields as work progresses. Use `docs/sprint-status.yaml` as the single source of truth for implementation tracking.
  - Sprint moved to implementation: top priority stories set to `in-progress` and assignees names added.
  - Update statuses to `done` once story acceptance criteria are met and PRs merged.
