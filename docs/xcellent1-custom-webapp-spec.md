# Xcellent1 — Web App Spec (summary)

This short spec summarizes the core features required for a business management
web app: customer management, job scheduling, invoicing, crew mobile view, owner
dashboard and automated weekly updates. The full detailed specification (DB
schema, UI flows, timelines) is archived at
`docs/archive/xcellent1-custom-webapp-spec.full.md`.

Core recommendations:

- Build MVP with Glide/Bubble for speed, then migrate to Next.js + Supabase if
  you outgrow the platform.
- Focus: recurring scheduling, mobile photo upload, invoice & payment links,
  owner weekly SMS summary.

See the archived full spec for complete details.
