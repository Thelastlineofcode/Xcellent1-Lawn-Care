## Tab-by-Tab Instructions

### Tab 1: Revenue & Financial Snapshot (Last 3 Months)

**What to gather:**
- Bank statements or accounting records for September, October, November 2025
- Invoice totals or payment receipts
- Expense records (payroll, fuel, equipment, insurance, etc.)

**How to fill:**
- **Total Revenue**: Sum of all customer payments received each month
- **Total Expenses**: Sum of all business costs (labor, gas, equipment repairs, insurance, etc.)
- **Net Profit**: Revenue minus Expenses
- **Gross Margin %**: (Net Profit ÷ Total Revenue) × 100

**Why it matters:** Establishes your baseline. If you're at $8K/month now, reaching $25K takes different steps than if you're at $15K/month.

**Example:**
- September Revenue: $6,500
- September Expenses: $4,200
- September Net Profit: $2,300
- Gross Margin: 35%

### Tab 2: Customer Base Overview

**What to gather:**
- Customer list (phone contacts, CRM, or written records)
- Count recurring vs. one-time customers
- Note any commercial/HOA accounts

**How to fill:**
- **Total Active Customers**: Anyone who has used your service in last 3 months
- **Recurring Monthly Contracts**: Customers with weekly/bi-weekly agreements
- **One-Time/As-Needed**: Customers who call when they need service
- **Commercial/HOA Contracts**: List any business or HOA properties (even informal)
- **Average Monthly Revenue per Customer**: Total monthly revenue ÷ total customers

**Why it matters:** Determines whether you need to focus on customer acquisition (if you have 15 customers) vs. retention and upselling (if you have 60 customers).

**Example:**
- 45 total active customers
- 30 recurring contracts
- 15 one-time customers
- 1 small commercial account (office building)
- Average revenue per customer: $180/month

---

### Tab 3: Current Pricing Structure

**What to gather:**
- Your current price quotes or typical charges
- List of services you offer (or want to offer)

**How to fill:**
- For each service, enter the price range you currently charge
- Mark "Y" if you currently offer it, "N" if you don't
- Add notes about frequency (weekly, monthly, seasonal)

**Why it matters:** Identifies underpriced services and gaps in your offerings. If you're charging $40/mow when competitors charge $55-65, you're leaving money on the table.

**Example:**
- Basic Mowing: $50-60 per visit (Y)
- Weekly Package: $180/month (Y)
- Fertilization: Not offered yet (N)
- Aeration: $400 per service (Y) - offered 2x/year

---

### Tab 4: Team & Operations

**What to gather:**
- List of everyone who works for the business
- Their pay rates and hours worked
- How long they've been with you

**How to fill:**
- Include yourself (Lacardio) as Owner
- For each employee: name, W-2 vs 1099 vs informal, hours/week, pay rate, role
- Note how long they've been working with you

**Why it matters:** Determines labor cost structure and identifies retention issues. If you have 3 employees who've each been there <6 months, there's a turnover problem costing you money.

**Example:**
- Lacardio Francis: Owner, 10 hrs/week managing
- Employee 1: W-2, 30 hrs/week, $16/hour, Crew Lead, 18 months
- Employee 2: Informal, 20 hrs/week, $15/hour, Crew, 4 months

---

### Tab 5: Equipment Inventory

**What to gather:**
- List all equipment you own or use
- Note condition and who owns it

**How to fill:**
- Count each piece of equipment
- Mark condition (Good/Fair/Poor)
- Note if it's company-owned or an employee brings their own
- Estimate replacement cost if you had to buy new today

**Why it matters:** Identifies capacity constraints. If you only have 2 mowers and want to scale to 100 customers, you need to budget for more equipment.

**Example:**
- 1 riding mower (Fair condition, company-owned, $3,500 replacement)
- 3 push mowers (Good condition, 2 company / 1 employee-owned)
- 2 trucks (Good condition, company-owned)

---

### Tab 6: Lead Sources (Last 90 Days)

**What to gather:**
- Think about the last 10-15 new customers
- Where did they find you?

**How to fill:**
- Estimate what % of new leads come from each source
- If you know exact numbers, enter them
- Estimate conversion rate (what % of leads become customers)

**Why it matters:** Shows where to focus marketing dollars. If 60% of your customers come from referrals, you should invest in a referral bonus program. If 40% come from Google, optimize your Google Business Profile immediately.

**Example:**
- Google/GBP: 30% of leads, ~8 leads/month, 50% convert
- Referrals: 45% of leads, ~12 leads/month, 70% convert
- Facebook: 15% of leads, ~4 leads/month, 25% convert
- Yard signs: 10% of leads

---

### Tab 7: Digital Presence & Systems

**What to gather:**
- Your Google Business Profile info
- Social media accounts
- Any software/tools you use

**How to fill:**
- Answer Y/N questions
- Count reviews, followers, photos
- List software you use (Jobber, spreadsheets, QuickBooks, etc.)
- Note pain points with current systems

**Why it matters:** Identifies quick wins. If your GBP has 8 reviews, getting to 30+ reviews is a free lead generation boost. If you're using spreadsheets for 50+ customers, you need software immediately.

**Example:**
- GBP: Claimed but not fully verified
- 12 reviews, 4.6 stars
- 3 photos uploaded, last post 6 months ago
- Instagram: 120 followers, post 1-2x/week
- No CRM, using Google Sheets for scheduling
- Accept cash/check only, no online payment

---

### Tab 8: Service Area & Capacity

**What to gather:**
- Map of where your customers are located
- Typical drive times between jobs

**How to fill:**
- List cities/zip codes you primarily serve
- Note maximum drive time you're willing to accept
- Estimate jobs completed per day per crew
- Identify your main bottleneck (not enough equipment? not enough staff? too much drive time?)

**Why it matters:** Determines expansion strategy. If you're maxed out in Laplace, expand to Norco. If you have 30-minute gaps between jobs, route optimization saves 8-10 hours/week.

**Example:**
- Primary: Laplace 70068, 70069
- Also serve: Norco (occasionally)
- Max drive: 25 minutes tolerated
- Average 6-8 jobs/day per crew
- Average 15 min drive between jobs
- Can take more customers: Yes, have capacity
- Bottleneck: Need better scheduling system

---

### Tab 9: Business Structure & Compliance

**What to gather:**
- Business licenses, insurance policies, LLC paperwork

**How to fill:**
- Mark Y/N for each item
- Add policy numbers and expiration dates if applicable

**Why it matters:** Identifies legal/insurance gaps before they become problems. If you don't have workers' comp insurance and an employee gets hurt, you're personally liable. If you want to bid HOA contracts, you need proof of insurance.

**Example:**
- LLC established 2023
- Business license: Yes, active
- General liability: Yes, State Farm, expires 3/2026
- Workers comp: No (need to get)
- No pesticide license yet

---

### Tab 10: Growth Goals & Investment Capacity

**What to gather:**
- Your vision for the business
- Available cash or financing

**How to fill:**
- Set realistic revenue targets (1-year and 3-year)
- Decide how many hours/week you can commit
- Choose growth pace (aggressive vs conservative)
- Note how much money you can invest in next 6 months
- Define your long-term goal (sell business? ongoing income? pass to family?)

**Why it matters:** Aligns strategy with your actual goals. If you want to keep your day job and work 5 hrs/week, the strategy is different than if you want to go full-time and scale aggressively.

**Example:**
- 1-year target: $18K/month ($216K annual)
- 3-year target: $35K/month ($420K annual)
- Lacardio availability: 6-8 hours/week
- Growth preference: Moderate
- Investment capacity: $3,000 in next 6 months
- Goal: Build sustainable income stream, possibly sell in 5-7 years

---

### Tab 11: Key Metrics

**What to gather:**
- Any tracking you already do
- Customer feedback or satisfaction data

**How to fill:**
- Enter current values if you track them
- Mark "UNKNOWN" if you don't currently track
- Add notes about how you measure (if applicable)

**Why it matters:** Identifies operational gaps. If you don't know your response time to leads, you might be losing 40% of potential customers to faster competitors.

**Example:**
- Response time: Usually within 2-4 hours
- Churn: ~2 customers/month cancel
- On-time completion: ~90% (rough estimate)
- Avg ticket: $55 per visit
- Marketing spend: $50-100/month on Facebook
- Don't track: customer acquisition cost, revenue per crew

---

### Tab 12: Competitive Intelligence

**What to gather:**
- Your experience interacting with customers
- Knowledge of local competitors

**How to fill:**
- List top 3 reasons potential customers don't book
- Name 2-3 main competitors in Laplace
- Be honest about what they do better AND what you do better
- Describe your typical customer profile

**Why it matters:** Shapes positioning and marketing messaging. If customers say "you're too expensive," you either need to justify premium pricing or adjust. If competitors are unreliable, emphasize your reliability in all marketing.

**Example:**
- Top objections: "Too expensive," "Already have someone," "Not sure we need weekly service"
- Main competitors: "ABC Lawn Care," "Joe's Mowing," "TruGreen (national)"
- They do better: Bigger trucks, more equipment, professional website
- We do better: Personal service, faster response, local knowledge, actually show up
- Typical customer: Middle-class homeowners, $60K-$80K income, 0.25-0.5 acre lots

## Tips for Best Results

**Be Honest:** There's no "right" answer. If you don't track something, write "UNKNOWN" - that tells us what systems to implement first.

**Use Estimates:** If you don't have exact numbers, estimate. "~$7,000/month revenue" is far more useful than leaving it blank.

**Add Context:** Use the Notes columns to explain unique situations. "Customer churn is high because we had equipment breakdowns for 2 months" is valuable context.

**Ask for Help:** If you don't understand a question, text/call for clarification. It's better to ask than guess wrong.

**One Sitting Preferred:** Try to complete in one 30-60 minute session while the information is fresh. Stopping and starting takes longer.

## Common Questions

**Q: What if I don't have financial records for the last 3 months?**  
A: Estimate from bank statements or credit card charges. Even rough numbers (±20% accuracy) are sufficient to start.

**Q: What if I don't know my gross margin?**  
A: Just fill in revenue and expenses - we'll calculate margins for you. If you truly don't know expenses, estimate: "~60% of revenue goes to labor and fuel."

**Q: Do I need to list every single customer?**  
A: No, just the total count and breakdown (recurring vs one-time). You don't need individual names.

**Q: What if I've only been in business 6 months?**  
A: That's fine - use whatever historical data you have (even 1-2 months). We'll adjust projections accordingly.

**Q: What if I don't have employees yet (just me)?**  
A: List yourself in the Team tab and mark the rest "N/A" - the strategy will address when and how to hire.

**Q: Can I skip sections that don't apply?**  
A: Mark them "N/A" but don't skip entirely. For example, if you don't have commercial accounts yet, write "0" - that tells us it's a growth opportunity.
