# Xcellent1 Lawn Care

> Workflow analysis completed: sprint-status.yaml and bmm-workflow-status.yaml
> read and summarized. Management System

A complete lawn care business management platform built with Deno, Supabase, and
vanilla JavaScript.

> NOTE: The documentation in this repo has been cleaned and trimmed for clarity.
> Large/long reference documents were archived under `docs/archive/` and
> replaced with short summaries in `docs/` to make onboarding faster. Full
> originals are retained in `docs/archive/`.

Core operational playbooks:

- `docs/LACARDIO_DASHBOARD_GUIDE.md` — User guide for LaCardio

## AI & Agent Features

- Experimental AI and agent prototypes reside under
  `bmad/agents/archived/langchain-integration/` and `src/skills/` for research
  and future implementation.
- These prototypes are **archived and disabled by default**; they are not part
  of the active code path or CI runs unless explicitly enabled via CI
  environment flags (e.g., `ENABLE_AI_TESTS=true`).
  - For TypeScript/Deno prototype modules, set `ENABLE_AI_PROTOTYPES=true` and
    pass `--allow-env` to Deno when testing or running them.
  - Future: a TTS-enabled simple agent is planned but suspended for now.

   cd Xcellent1-Lawn-Care
   ```

---

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# Database (from Supabase Project Settings → Database)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@db.[PROJECT-REF].supabase.co:5432/postgres

# Supabase (from Supabase Project Settings → API)
SUPABASE_URL=https://[PROJECT-REF].supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[YOUR-ANON-KEY]
SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET=[YOUR-JWT-SECRET]

# Server
PORT=8000
APP_ENV=development
```

**Finding Supabase Credentials**:

1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click **Settings** → **API**
   - Copy **URL** → SUPABASE_URL
   - Copy **anon/public** key → SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
4. Click **Settings** → **Database**
   - Copy **Connection string** → DATABASE_URL (replace [YOUR-PASSWORD])
5. Click **Settings** → **API** → **JWT Settings**
   - Copy **JWT Secret** → SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET

### 2. Database Setup

#### Option A: Supabase SQL Editor (Recommended)

1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click **SQL Editor** in left sidebar
4. Click **New Query**
5. Run each SQL file in order:

```sql
-- 1. Core schema
\i db/schema.sql

-- 2. Waitlist feature
\i db/waitlist_schema.sql

-- 3. Enhanced metrics (if exists)
\i db/enhanced_owner_metrics.sql
```

Copy the contents of each file and run in the SQL Editor.

#### Option B: psql Command Line

```bash
# Ensure psql is installed
psql --version

# Run migrations
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f db/schema.sql
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f db/waitlist_schema.sql
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f db/enhanced_owner_metrics.sql
```

### 3. Supabase Storage Setup

Follow the guide in `db/SETUP_SUPABASE_STORAGE.md` to:

1. Create the `job-photos` storage bucket
2. Set up public access policies
3. Configure upload permissions

**Quick Setup** (via Supabase Dashboard):

1. Go to **Storage** → **New Bucket**
2. Name: `job-photos`
3. Check ✅ **Public bucket**
4. Create bucket
5. Go to **Policies** tab
6. Add the policies from `db/SETUP_SUPABASE_STORAGE.md`

### 4. Authentication Setup

1. In Supabase Dashboard, go to **Authentication** → **Providers**
2. Enable **Email** provider (enabled by default)
3. (Optional) Configure email templates for password reset, etc.

### 5. Create Demo Data (Optional)

The schema includes sample data for testing. To load it:

```sql
-- Already included in db/schema.sql (lines 195-248)
-- Creates owner, crew members, and a sample client
```

Or create users manually:

1. Go to **Authentication** → **Users** → **Add user**
2. Create test accounts for owner, crew, and client roles

---

## 🚢 Production Deployments (Fly.io)

When deploying to production with Fly.io, the app must run in production mode
and **cannot** use the local file-backed fallback. Use `APP_ENV=production` and
ensure the following secrets are set in Fly or CI:

- `DATABASE_URL` (required)
- `SUPABASE_URL` (required)
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (required)
- `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` (required)

Set Fly secrets before you deploy:

```bash
flyctl secrets set DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@..." \
   SUPABASE_URL="https://<ref>.supabase.co" \
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="<anon>" SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET="<jwt>" \
   --app <your-fly-app>
```

Then deploy with our helper (CI or local):

```bash
APP_ENV=production FLY_APP_NAME=<your-fly-app> ./scripts/deploy_fly.sh
```

For CI/CD: Use the `deploy-flyio.yml` GitHub Actions workflow. Ensure these
repository secrets are configured: `FLY_API_TOKEN`, `DATABASE_URL`,
`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`, `FLY_APP_NAME`.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Server won't start

- Check Deno is installed: `deno --version`
- Verify `.env` file exists with correct variables
- Check port 8000 is not in use: `lsof -i :8000`

### Database connection fails

- Verify DATABASE_URL is correct
- Check Supabase project is active
- Ensure PostgreSQL port (5432) is accessible
- Test connection: `psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT 1"`

### Authentication errors

- Verify SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET is set
- Check JWT token is valid (use jwt.io to decode)
- Ensure user exists in `users` table with correct role
- Verify RLS policies are enabled

### Photos not uploading

- Check Supabase Storage bucket exists: `job-photos`
- Verify bucket is set to Public
- Check upload policies are configured
- See `db/SETUP_SUPABASE_STORAGE.md` for setup

### Payment verification not working

- Ensure payments have "Self-reported" in notes field
- Check client-marked payments in database
- Verify owner has authenticated access
- Check pending payments query results

## 📊 Monitoring

### Health Check

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
# Should return: {"status":"ok"}
```

### Database Status

-- Check table counts
SELECT
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users) as users,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM clients) as clients,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM jobs) as jobs,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM invoices) as invoices,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM waitlist) as waitlist;
```

### Storage Usage
